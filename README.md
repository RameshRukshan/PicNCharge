<h1 style="margin: 0in 0in 3.9pt -.25pt;">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in .2pt 7.75pt -.25pt;">Now a days in worldwide, the automotive industry is changing quickly due to the rapid development of Electric Vehicle (EV) technology, as well as other counties in the world Sri Lanka is no exception with this Electric Vehicle Technology. Because of this, accessible and effective electric vehicle charging infrastructure is becoming more and more important to the more people in Sri Lanka to adopt EVs as a sustainable and environmentally friendly mode of transportation. We suggest the creation of a mobile application for finding Electric Vehicle charging stations that accessible and available to the Sri Lankans across the nation in order to assist this transition and easier to reach.</p>
<h1 style="margin: 0in 0in 3.9pt -.25pt;">PROBLEM</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in .2pt .5pt -.25pt;">When moving to Electric Vehicle technology there is many problems that people have, when it comes to Eclectic Vehicle Charging stations there is some of the main problems currently have in Sri Lanka, those are,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin: 0in .2pt .5pt 36.05pt;"><span style="line-height: 105%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">&bull;<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> Lack of knowledge of charging station's locations</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin: 0in .2pt .5pt 36.05pt;"><span style="line-height: 105%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">&bull;<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> Uncertainty About Charging Station Availability</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin: 0in .2pt .5pt 36.05pt;"><span style="line-height: 105%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">&bull;<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> Lack of Pricing Transparency</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin: 0in .2pt .5pt 36.05pt;"><span style="line-height: 105%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">&bull;<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> Difficulty in Finding Charging Stations</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%; margin: 0in 0in 0in 36.05pt;" align="left"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; line-height: 107%;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; line-height: 102%; margin: 0in 0in .3pt -.25pt;" align="left">One of the primary obstacles faced by electric vehicle users in Sri Lanka is the lack of easily accessible information about the locations of electric car charging stations. Many potential EV owners are unaware of where these stations are situated, hindering their decision to transition to electric cars.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; line-height: 102%; margin: 0in 0in .3pt -.25pt;" align="left">Even if users are aware of charging stations, they often face uncertainty about the availability of charging slots. This unpredictability can lead to inconveniences and discourage EV usage as users may not know if a charging station is occupied or available when needed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; line-height: 102%; margin: 0in 0in .3pt -.25pt;" align="left">Another challenge is the absence of transparent pricing information for electric car charging stations. Users require clear and readily available information about charging costs to make informed decisions regarding their electric vehicle usage.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; line-height: 102%; margin: 0in 0in 7.65pt -.25pt;" align="left">Locating charging stations can be challenging, particularly for those unfamiliar with the area or in areas with limited signage. A lack of clear directions and navigation to charging stations can deter potential EV users and limit the adoption of electric cars.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; text-indent: 0in; line-height: 107%; margin: 0in 0in 8.0pt 0in;" align="left"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h1 style="margin: 0in 0in 3.9pt -.25pt;">CURRENT SOLUTION</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in .2pt 9.5pt -.25pt;">Since countries like Sri Lanka is still adopting to technologies like Eclectic Vehicles, there is few limited versions of solutions are using people who use public charging stations. Some of them are,&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin: 0in .2pt .5pt 36.05pt;"><span style="line-height: 105%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">&bull;<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> Word of Mouth</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin: 0in .2pt .5pt 36.05pt;"><span style="line-height: 105%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">&bull;<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> Manufacturer Apps</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin: 0in .2pt .5pt 36.05pt;"><span style="line-height: 105%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">&bull;<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> Direct Contact with Charging Station Operators</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin: 0in .2pt .5pt 36.05pt;"><span style="line-height: 105%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">&bull;<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> Exploration while driving</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -.25in; margin: 0in .2pt 5.4pt 36.05pt;"><span style="line-height: 105%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">&bull;<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> Buying own charging unit and travel along with that</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in .2pt 7.95pt -.25pt;">Many individuals rely on word-of-mouth recommendations or online forums to discover the locations of electric car charging stations. They might ask friends, family, or fellow EV enthusiasts for information or search online forums and social media groups for user-generated content about charging station locations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in .2pt .5pt -.25pt;">Some electric car manufacturers provide their own in-built applications that offer information about charging station locations, but the problem is those applications are not UpToDate with our countries. So sometimes that information isn't accurate, and we can't rely on it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in .2pt 11.7pt -.25pt;">In some cases, users might attempt to contact charging station operators directly to inquire about availability and pricing. However, this can be time-consuming and may not always yield accurate, up-to-date information.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in .2pt 7.7pt -.25pt;">Users may embark on exploration drives in search of charging stations, relying on luck to stumble upon one. This method is inefficient and may lead to range anxiety, as users may not be sure of finding a station when needed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in .2pt .5pt -.25pt;">Also, as a solution some of the Electric Vehicle owners are buying expensive, portable EV charging units and when they are traveling, they are bringing the charging unit along with them. Also, most of the quality and effective charging units are much more expensive than the charging station and the fun fact is most of the portable charging units are powered up with deiseal and it is misusing the value of Electric Vehicle concept.&nbsp;</p>
